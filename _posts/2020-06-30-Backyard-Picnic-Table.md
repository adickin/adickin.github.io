Since moving into a new house back in February my wife and I have been searching for a patio table for the backyard.  There is a plethora of sizes/shapes, and colours to choose from but at the end of the day all we really wanted was a basic table we could sit around and have a beer. Since that was the case, we decided we could just make our own picnic table but remove the benches picnic tables usually have.  I should also mention that we had recently renovated a house so we already had invested in all the tools you would need to make a picnic table( Drill, Mitre Saw, Hammer, Painting equipment, Tape Measures, etc).  Upon sharing our idea with some friends, they decided they wanted to join us on the build and make a table for themselves too.

After searching online I found these excellent plans at [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/picnic-table-1/).  The picnic table is a step above normal picnic tables and looks fantastic with the mitered box for the outside edge.  As you'll quickly see below we did not build the benches as they were described in the plans.

The build started off without a hitch, following the plans for the table top was quite easy to do, but when we got to the modified legs we hit a bit of a snag.  A quick google search will tell you that a standard table is approximately 28-30 inches to the top of the surface.  At this height most chairs will fit correctly with the table and not limit us on future chair choices. If we followed the plans as they were written for the table legs then our final height was going to end up around ~26 inches which would not be ideal.  So in order to get the table to the proper height, some high school math had to be busted out. I dont know about you but I cant remember last time I used pythagoras theorem.  Thankfully we live in a world of quick to find online [calculators](https://www.calculator.net/pythagorean-theorem-calculator.html) so we didn't have to actually do all the calculations by hand.  Initially we plugged in our width of 713mm(~28 inches) and our height as 762mm(30 inches) which gave us a diagonal length of ~1043mm. We then used a [triangle angle calculator](https://www.calculator.net/triangle-calculator.html) to determine what angle our cuts would need to be at on the mitre saw.

Unfortunately for us, given our current set of tools it would have been impossible to set the mitre saw at a 46.9 degree angle. Playing with the numbers a bit we eventually managed to get a triangle that had both angles that were a .5 increment, 44.5 degrees and 45.5 degrees. This then left us with the legs having a height of 725mm(~28.54 inches).  Turns out this was a happy little accident as we had forgotten to factor in the height of the table top, a standard 2x4, which is 1.5 inches for a total of 30 inches.

Once we had that all sorted out there were no more major hiccups and the tables went together quite smoothly as we followed the original plans.

Here is the table right after we finished the build without any staining.

Finally, here is a picture of the second table that was made on the same day.  My friend chose a slightly less dark stain color and I think it turned out quite nice as well.

I hope you enjoyed reading this, hopefully in the future I remember to take more photos of the actual build process as I found I had taken none!
